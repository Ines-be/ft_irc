# IRC (C++98) ‚Äî RFC-Compliant IRC Server & Client

## üí¨ Overview

**IRC++** is a fully **RFC-compliant Internet Relay Chat (IRC)** server and client written in **C++98**.  
It uses the `select()` system call to handle multiple clients **concurrently and non-blockingly** over **TCP/IP**.

The server allows users to:
- **Chat privately** or in channels  
- **Join and manage channels** using standard IRC commands  
- **Set channel options**, such as:
  - Invite-only access  
  - Channel key (password)  
  - Topic restrictions  
  - Operator privileges  
  - User limits  

A built-in **moderation bot** is present in every channel. It automatically **kicks users who send forbidden words**.  

You can connect using any standard IRC client, such as **irssi**, or test directly with **netcat**.


## üöÄ Features
