# IRC (C++98) ‚Äî RFC-Compliant IRC Server & Client

## üí¨ Overview
IRC++ is a fully **RFC-compliant Internet Relay Chat (IRC)** server and client implemented in **C++98**.  
It uses `select()` to handle multiple clients concurrently in a **non-blocking** manner over **TCP/IP**.  
Users can chat privately, join channels, and manage them through standard IRC commands and modes.  
Channel operators can set options such as invite-only mode, channel key, topic restrictions, operator privileges, and user limits.  
The project includes a built-in **moderation bot** present in every channel that automatically kicks users using forbidden words.  
It can be tested with standard IRC clients like **irssi**, or simply with **netcat**.  

## üöÄ Features
